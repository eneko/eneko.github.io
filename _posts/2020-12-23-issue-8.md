A couple of weeks ago, on December 8-10, I took a three day class for AWS training. Really intensive, but definitely worth it. The week after, I got the AWS Developer Associate certificate 🎉

I took some notes during training that I don't want to lose, so I decided to write them on a post, for future review and in hopes that they can help someone else. Please beware these notes are pretty scarce and might not make much sense without the presentation slides and videos from the training.

## Day One

AWS offers solutions for IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. Some examples are:
- IaaS ([EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/), [ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ecs/))
- PaaS ([DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/))
- SaaS ([AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/) apps)

On cloud hosting:
- VMs need a guest OS to run (slow boot times, and resource overhead)
- Containers need orchestration (non-trivial)
- Server-less -> 🚀

AWS launched in 2006 with only 3 services: [EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2), [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3), and [SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sqs)

All services provide an API to perform any tasks. 
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/index.html) and [AWS management console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/getting-started.html) both use the REST API 
- **Everything** you can do in the AWS console can be done via API
- API requests must be signed ([Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html))

### Observability 
- Monitoring, logging, tracing
- [CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch) -> logs, events
- [CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail) -> auditing tool, not real-time
- [X-Ray](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray) -> service maps, identify performance bottlenecks

## [IAM Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html)
- Only three services support inline policies: S3, SQS, OpsWorks
- Use managed policies when possible
- With IAM, everything is _deny_ by default
  1. Explicit deny
  2. Explicit allow

[IAM Policy Simulator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_testing-policies.html) -> Troubleshooting of permission issues

IAM Role === Identity (cannot have two identities at once)

[Trusted Advisor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-support) (support)
- Save money
- Security tips
- Identify security risks

Identities:
- User
- Role

[`GetSessionToken`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetSessionToken.html) API call for MFA (multi-factor authentication)

[STS AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) operation -> no MFA

## [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3)
- 11 nines -> durability 
- 4 nines -> availability
- S3 is an object store (not files)
- Bucket names must be globally unique, always lowercase
  - 1024 characters max
  - Must be DNS compatible

[S3 versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectVersioning.html):
- Must delete all versions one by one
- Deleting a file inserts a "delete mark"

[S3 select](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-glacier-select-sql-reference-select.html):
- individual document basis
- query data inside documents (eg. JSON documents)

[Athena](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/what-is.html) -> cross-document queries with actual SQL statements

[S3 pre-signed urls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html)
- avoid leechers
- temporary urls that expire after a threshold
