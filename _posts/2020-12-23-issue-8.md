<span class="issue-number"><b>Issue <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/eneko/Blog/issues/8">#8</a></b></span>

A couple of weeks ago, on December 8-10, I took a three day class for AWS training. Really intensive, but definitely worth it. The week after, I got the AWS Developer Associate certificate 🎉

I took some notes during training that I don't want to lose, so I decided to write them on a post, for future review and in hopes that they can help someone else. Please beware these notes are pretty scarce and might not make much sense without the presentation slides and videos from the training.

## Day One

AWS offers solutions for IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. Some examples are:
- IaaS (EC2, ECS)
- PaaS (DynamoDB, Lambda)
- SaaS (AWS Marketplace apps)

On cloud hosting:
- VMs need a guest OS to run (slow boot times, and resource overhead)
- Containers need orchestration (non-trivial)
- Server-less -> 🚀

AWS launched in 2006 with only 3 services: EC2, S3, and SQS

All services provide an API to perform any tasks. 
- AWS CLI and AWS Console both use the REST API 
- Everything you can do in the AWS console can be done via API
- API requests must be signed (Signature Version 4)

### Observability 
- Monitoring, logging, tracing
- CloudWatch -> logs, events
- CloudTrail -> auditing tool, not real-time
- X-Ray -> service maps, identify performance bottlenecks

## IAM Policies
- Only three services support inline policies: S3, SQS, OpsWorks
- Use managed policies when possible
- With IAM, everything is _deny_ by default
  1. Explicit deny
  2. Explicit allow

IAM Policy Simulator -> Troubleshooting of permission issues

IAM Role === Identity (cannot have two identities at once)

Trusted Advisor
- Save money
- Security tips
- Identify security risks

Identities:
- User
- Role

`GetSessionToken` API call for MFA (multi-factor authentication)

STS AssumeRole operation -> no MFA

## S3

- 11 nines -> durability 
- 4 nines -> availability
- S3 is an object store (not files)
- Bucket names must be globally unique, always lowercase
  - 1024 characters max
  - Must be DNS compatible

S3 versioning:
- Must delete all versions one by one
- Deleting a file inserts a "delete mark"

S3 select:
- individual document basis
- query data inside documents (eg. JSON documents)

Athena -> cross-document queries with actual SQL statements

S3 pre-signed urls
- avoid leechers
- temporary urls that expire after a threshold

---

## Day Two

Neptune -> Graph database

Aurora -> Serverless relational database (MySQL or Postgres)

### DynamoDB
- Partitions up to 10GB
- Primary Key -> Partition Key + Sort Key (optional)
- 400Kb per item max, including attribute names
- Throughput is divided among partitions
- 5 max Local Secondary Indexes (LSI) before table creation
- 20 max Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) -> new PK/SK, can be added at any time
- Sparse index: when GSI PK does not exist on an item in the table

DynamoDB Streams -> S3 (JSON)
DynamoDB Streams -> SNS
DynamoDB Streams -> Lambda

Global tables -> multi-master arrangement

DynamoDB Transactions
- 10 items max
- 4MB max

Batch -> 16MB

DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)
- write-through cache (latency)
- write around for heavy write applications

### AWS Secrets Manager
- key/value store
- rotate secrets

### AWS Lambda
- Max duration: 15 min
- Lambda Service (managed)
  - poll for events
  - pull invokation
- Reserved concurrency
  - limit number of concurrent invocations
  - max concurrent invocations
- Provisioned concurrency
  - warm lambda instances
  - avoid cold starts
  - runs continuously
- Canary deploys with aliases and versions
  - 1% - 99%, 10% - 90%, etc
- Lambda destination for async invocations: success / failure
- Initial burst: 500-3000 cus
  - +500/minute afterwards
  - 1000 cus max/region by default

### SALAD
Remember LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP)?  

SALAD is the new stack:
- S3
- API Gateway
- Lambda
- ?
- DynamoDB

### API Gateway (REST)
- Sell API keys on AWS marketplace
- 10k requests/sec 
- Throttle + daily quotes

Cloud Formation -> Infrastructure as code

### SQS
- Idempotence -> write consumers for no issues if duplicate messages are received
- 14 days max time for messages to stay in queue
- SQS -> 1:1 only one consumer can get a message
- Dead Letter Queue (DQL) for failed messages
- SQS FIFO -> MessageDeduplicationId + SendMsg
- When using Lambda consumers, polling is handled by Lambda Service

### SNS
- 1:N multiple subscribers per topic
- Retry policy
- SNS filters -> avoid invocations
- Order of messages is not guaranteed
- FIFO supported on SNS since Dec 2020 re:Invent
- No persistence
- 256Kb max per message

Use SNS to _fanout_: 
```
                                      ┌───────────┐       ┌───────────┐
                                      │           │       │           │
                                 ┌───▶│    SQS    │──────▶│Consumer A │
┌───────────┐   ┌───────────┐    │    │           │       │           │
│           │   │           │    │    └───────────┘       └───────────┘
│ Producer  │──▶│    SNS    │────┤

└───────────┘   └───────────┘    │    │           │       │           │
                                 └───▶│    SQS    │──────▶│Consumer B │
                                      │           │       │           │
                                      └───────────┘       └───────────┘
```

### Amazon MQ
- Runs Apache MQ

- MQTT for IoT
  - AWS IoT Broker message -> MQTT

### Step Functions
- Allow for manual approval steps
- State saved for one year max

### ElastiCache
- Memcached: multi-threaded, single availability zone

### Containers
- Docker: only one process per container
- Container = runtime engine + dependencies + code + configuration
- ECR
  - Public images since Dec 2020
  - Integrated with Docker CLI
  - ECR ~= Docker Hub

### Container Orchestration
- Kubernetes & ECS
- Provide them with a fleet of EC2 instances

Container -> Task (auto-scaling) -> ECS -> EC2 instance (auto-scaling)

### AWS Fargate
- Forget about managing EC2 instances.
- No choice of instance type
- No ssh into EC2 instance
- Server-less provision of containers

### EKS
- Elastic Kubernetes Cluster

And that is it. As mentioned, not the best notes ever, but better than nothing :)
