I'm sitting in the couch te-reading The Pragmatic Programmer, and couldn't but share this quote. 

> ...we believe that the best format for storing knowledge persistently is _plain text_. With plain text, we give ourselves the ability to manipulate knowledge, both manually and programmatically, using virtually every tool at our disposal.

> The problem with most binary formats is that the context necessary to understand the data is separate from the data itself. You are artificially divorcing the data from its meaning. The data might as well be encrypted; it is absolutely meaningless without the application logic to parse it.

The reasoning is solid: you can write an application to parse plain-text from 50 years ago (see [RFC 561](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc561) which describes Email headers, as an example), and arguably you could do it without ever reading the specification. Something like that would be really hard to do with a binary file format.

It is a good tip to keep in mind when writing applications that save documents, data or state to disk.
