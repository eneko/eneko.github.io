Long title for something that should be simple, but actually kind of hard to search online.

Scenario/prerequisites:
1. A Swift Package (library/command line) for iOS or macOS
2. An image file (png or jpeg)
3. SwiftUI :)

## Step 1: Add resources to the Swift package

If your package doesn't have any resources yet, follow these steps:
1. Create a `Resources` folder inside your library code (eg. `/Sources/MyLibrary/Resources`)
2. Drop your image(s) inside that folder
3. In `Package.swift`, add the resources to your target:
    ```swift
    .target(name: "MyLibrary", dependencies: [], resources: [.process("Resources")]),
    ```

## Step 2: Use the image in SwiftUI

It seems that, unfortunately, as of June 1 2021, with Xcode 12.5, SwiftUI still does not support loading image resources from
a Swift Package bundle. This seems to work only with an Assets catalog in a normal Xcode project. Thus, the following
examples won't work:

```swift
var body: some View {
    Image("image").resizable()    // <-- this won't work ❌
    Image("image.png").resizable()    // <-- this won't work ❌
    Image("Resources/image.png").resizable()    // <-- this won't work ❌
    Image("image", bundle: Bundle.module).resizable()    // <-- this won't work ❌
    Image("image.png", bundle: Bundle.module).resizable()    // <-- this won't work ❌
}
```

Instead, we have to rely on `UIImage` for iOS and `NSImage` for macOS. Using `Bundle.module` we can retrieve the path of the image asset, and then load it with `UIImage` or `NSImage` as needed.

```swift
// UIKit
if let path = Bundle.module.path(forResource: name, ofType: type),
              let image = UIImage(contentsOfFile: path) {
  ...
}

// AppKit
if let path = Bundle.module.path(forResource: name, ofType: type),
              let image = NSImage(contentsOfFile: path) {
  ...
}
```

## Step 3: Add an extension for `Image`

This extension for `Image` handles both `AppKit` and `UIKit` frameworks well, and also works well with SwiftUI previews 🎉:

```swift
extension Image {
    init(packageResource name: String, ofType type: String) {
        #if canImport(UIKit)
        guard let path = Bundle.module.path(forResource: name, ofType: type),
              let image = UIImage(contentsOfFile: path) else {
            self.init(name)
            return
        }
        self.init(uiImage: image)
        #elseif canImport(AppKit)
        guard let path = Bundle.module.path(forResource: name, ofType: type),
              let image = NSImage(contentsOfFile: path) else {
            self.init(name)
            return
        }
        self.init(nsImage: image)
        #else
        self.init(name)
        #endif
    }
}
```

It will return an empty image if the resource cannot be found or if neither `UIKit` or `AppKit` can be imported.

## Step 4: Use the extension

We can then proceed to use this extension as follows:

```swift
var body: some View {
    Image(packageResource: "image", ofType: "png").resizable() // Works well ✅
}
```

Hope this helps!
