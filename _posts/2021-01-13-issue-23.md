Swift's [`Codable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable) protocol (together with `Encodable` and `Decodable`) was introduced in Xcode 9 with Swift 4. This changed for good how we encode and decode JSON.

## Encoding/Decoding JSON with `camelCase` keys

If we are lucky, the JSON we work with will follow Swift naming conventions. 

> Names of types and protocols are UpperCamelCase. Everything else is lowerCamelCase.

This convention uses lower camel case (`camelCase`) for object/struct property names. In this scenario, we can encode/decode JSON objects straight out of the box, without any modifications.

Given the following Swift structure:
```swift
struct Device: Codable {
    let deviceName: String
    let deviceModel: String
}
```

And the following JSON:
```json
{
    "deviceName": "iPhone 12 Pro",
    "deviceModel": "iPhone"
}
```

We can decode it as follows: 
```swift
let device = try JSONDecoder().decode(Device.self, from: json)
print(device.deviceName) // iPhone 12 Pro
```

Nothing new here, pretty straightforward ðŸ˜‰

## Encoding/Decoding JSON with `snake_case` keys

Snake case is the standard [naming convention in some programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case), like Python and Ruby. Thus, is pretty common to see `snake_case` used for JSON properties.

Fortunately, Swift includes an out-of-the-box solution to parse JSON in this format. [`JSONDecoder.KeyDecodingStrategy`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsondecoder/keydecodingstrategy) includes a convenient `convertFromSnakeCase` option (see `convertToSnakeCase` for `JSONEncoder`)

Given the following JSON:
```json
{
    "device_name": "iPhone 12 Pro",
    "device_model": "iPhone"
}
```

We can decode it as follows:
```swift
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
decoder.keyDecodingStrategy = .convertFromSnakeCase
let device = try decoder.decode(Device.self, from: json)
print(device.deviceName) // iPhone 12 Pro
```

Pretty cool. One line of code, and we are all set ðŸŽ‰

## Encoding/Decoding JSON with `CuSToM-CaSe` keys

What about other common cases? While `lowerCamelCase` and `snake_case` might be the two most popular formats for JSON object keys, some programming languages might have different conventions.

For example, [C# uses `PascalCase` for property names](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/identifier-names#naming-conventions), and it's common for C# APIs to return JSON in this format.

Example JSON with `PascalCase` keys:
```json
{
    "DeviceName": "iPhone 12 Pro",
    "DeviceModel": "iPhone"
}
```

A common way to handle these keys is by defining a `CodingKeys` enumeration conforming to `String & CodingKey`, as shown in [Apple documentation examples](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types) and many other articles.

Following this pattern, we would update our Swift structure as follows:

```swift
struct Device: Codable {
    let deviceName: String
    let deviceModel: String

    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case deviceName = "DeviceName"
        case deviceModel = "DeviceModel"
    }
}
```

By defining these custom keys, we can decode it as before: 
```swift
let device = try JSONDecoder().decode(Device.self, from: json)
print(device.deviceName) // iPhone 12 Pro
```

This is great, but... it has obvious downsides. For large data objects and specially large APIs, it can be tedious and repetitive to type down the coding keys for each property. Imagine having hundreds of properties among dozens of data transfer objects. Lots of boilerplate. While there are generator tools that can generate these coding keys for you, it is still not ideal.

My recommendation would be to define coding keys _only_ when working with inconsistent APIs and JSON payloads. This is, when there is a mix of formats and some properties use different formats. Sadly, this happens, and there are many APIs out there that lack any sense of consistency. In these scenarios, manually defining coding keys is the way to go.

So, what is the alternative?

Fortunately, both `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` allow for defining custom key encoding/decoding strategies. This can be a little tricky the first time, but it is worth the effort, specially if, as mentioned, the API you are working with is pretty consistent in a given format.

## Defining Custom Key Decoding Strategies

Going back to the above scenario where the JSON has keys in `PascalCase` format, we can define a custom strategy as follows. Here is our original bare structure, without manually defined coding keys:

```swift
struct Device: Codable {
    let deviceName: String
    let deviceModel: String
}
```

To define a custom strategy, first we will define a custom `CustomKey` type. This is because the strategy must return a type that conforms to `CodingKey` (same concept as the enumeration), and we cannot make instances of a protocol.

```swift
struct CustomKey: CodingKey {
    let stringValue: String
    let intValue: Int?

    init(stringValue: String) {
        self.stringValue = stringValue
        intValue = nil
    }

    init(intValue: Int) {
        self.intValue = intValue
        stringValue = String(intValue)
    }
}
```

Then we can use it to decode any type as follows:

```swift
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
decoder.keyDecodingStrategy = .custom { keys in
    let last = keys.last!.stringValue
    return CustomKey(stringValue: last.prefix(1).lowercased() + last.dropFirst())
}
let device = try decoder.decode(Device.self, from: json)
print(device.deviceName) // iPhone 12 Pro
```

Our custom strategy converts from `PascalCase` to `camelCase` to map any properties from C# naming convention to Swift.

The take away in this example is that we only need to define this once for all our data models and API endpoints consumed. As we develop our applications, we can keep adding and updating our data models without having to manually type or generate coding keys.

We can take this a step further by defining a specific `PascalCaseKey` type to encapsulate our conversion logic:

```swift
struct PascalCaseKey: CodingKey {
    let stringValue: String
    let intValue: Int?

    init(stringValue: String) {
        self.stringValue = stringValue.prefix(1).lowercased() + stringValue.dropFirst()
        intValue = nil
    }

    init(intValue: Int) {
        stringValue = String(intValue)
        self.intValue = intValue
    }
}
```

Then we can use it as follows:

```swift
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
decoder.keyDecodingStrategy = .custom { keys in PascalCaseKey(stringValue: keys.last!.stringValue) }
let device = try decoder.decode(Device.self, from: json)
print(device.deviceName) // iPhone 12 Pro
```

This is a very efficient way of defining a custom strategy for decoding JSON keys. As long as you can convert your keys to match your Swift property names, you can implement this for any key format.

## Extending `JSONDecoder` with Custom Key Decoding Strategies

If you are working on a framework or library, or simply would rather provide a simple solution for your application, it is possible to extend `JSONDecoder` (and `JSONEncoder`) to add custom key decoding/encoding strategies.

Based on the examples above, we can write this extension:
```swift
extension JSONDecoder.KeyDecodingStrategy {
    static var convertFromPascalCase: Self {
        .custom { keys in
            PascalCaseKey(stringValue: keys.last!.stringValue)
        }
    }
}
```

And use it as follows:
```swift
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
decoder.keyDecodingStrategy = .convertFromPascalCase
let device = try decoder.decode(Device.self, from: json)
print(device.deviceName) // iPhone 12 Pro
```

And voilÃ¡! No more manually defining coding keys for our data models ðŸŽ‰
