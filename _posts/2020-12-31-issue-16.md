I didn't want to end the year without completing this challenge, from [Scott Smith (@scottsmithdev)](https://twitter.com/scottsmithdev/status/1341395333973225473), to print out the lyrics of the song Twelve Days of Christmas without repeating any of the lyrics lines in code.

## The Lyrics

I found the lyrics on the internet, might not be exact punctuation, casing, etc.

```
🎄🎶 The Twelve Days Of Christmas 🎶🎄 

On the 1st day of Christmas
My true love gave to me:
A partridge in a pear tree.

## The code

I implemented this as a command line executable. I used `NumberFormatter`
for the day ordinal (unfortunatelly, there is no spelled-out ordinal fomatter). I also
used `usleep()` to slow down the print feed. Didn't spend time trying to match
the song too accurately, but better than nothing 😀

The code is relatively easy. One outer for loop for each of the twelve days, and 
one reverse inner loop for repeating the lyrics down to the first day.

Here is the source code (also published at [TwelveDaysOfChristmas](https://github.com/eneko/TwelveDaysOfChristmas)):

```swift
let title = "🎄🎶 The Twelve Days Of Christmas 🎶🎄"
let lyrics = [
    "On the %@ day of Christmas",
    "My true love gave to me:",
    "A partridge in a pear tree.",
    "And",
    "Two turtle doves,",
    "Three french hens,",
    "Four calling birds,",
    "Five golden rings,",
    "Six geese a-laying,",
    "Seven swans a-swimming,",
    "Eight maids a-milking,",
    "Nine ladies dancing,",
    "Ten lords a-leaping,",
    "'Leven pipers piping,",
    "Twelve drummers drumming,"
]

let lineSleep: UInt32 = 400000 // Make zero for instant print
let formatter = NumberFormatter()
formatter.numberStyle = .ordinal

print(title)
print()

for day in 1...12 {
    let ordinal = formatter.string(for: day) ?? ""
    print(String(format: lyrics[0], ordinal))
    usleep(lineSleep)
    print(lyrics[1])
    usleep(lineSleep)
    var currentLine = day + (day > 1 ? 2 : 1)
    repeat {
        print(lyrics[currentLine])
        currentLine -= 1;
        usleep(lineSleep)
    } while currentLine > 1
    print()
    usleep(3 * lineSleep)
}
```

Happy Holidays! 🎉🎄🎊🎇🎆
