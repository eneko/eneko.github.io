I started working on an updated architecture diagram to illustrate the current state of my Blog Engine, and decided to write about the tools I use.

## Why Keynote?

I am a big fan of [Dot](https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html), a text-based language for making undirected and directed graphs using only text. Among other things, I've used Dot for generating [Swift Package documentation with SourceDocs](https://github.com/eneko/SourceDocs/blob/master/docs/Package.md), or this [diagram of Bobiverse](https://github.com/eneko/Bobiverse) (first book). Using text-based tools is great for source-control and versioning. Dot is capable of rendering really complex graphs (check their [example gallery](https://www.graphviz.org/gallery/)). However, Dot support for images is very limited, and creating (and reading) architecture diagrams is often much easier when vendor icons are used.

For this, I found Keynote the perfect tool. There are many online editors, and other native apps to make diagrams, but they often feel slow and clunky when compared. Besides, presentations are often a great way to share knowledge, whether this is on the web, at conferences, or at your workplace, sharing knowledge and ideas with other coworkers and/or teams. Being good at making presentations can take you far.

### Presentation templates

Keynote, as well as Powerpoint and other slide editors, have a good list of presentation templates. Unless using a work template, I usually go with a bare one, picking either light or dark background.

### Vendor icons

If you are working with Amazon Web Services, I highly recommend downloading their [AWS Architecture Icons](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/). I prefer downloading their PowerPoint toolkit, since it includes icons for all their services, well organized by category, but also other resources, like group and resource icons.

For other vendors, many companies have a Media or Brand page for press releases, with downloadable assets and instructions on how to use their logos. Here is the [Media page for GitHub](https://github.com/logos), for example. As you can see, if you clicked on the link, they provide downloadable versions of their main logos. However, other logos, like Github Actions, are missing. In this case, I often rely on searching online for their logos, trying to find a good transparent png image.

## Let's make a diagram

I started this article saying I was working on an updated version of an architecture diagram for my Blog Engine. Well, that was kind of a lie. I hadn't started yet, so here we go. There is really not much to it, so I'll focus on the key parts. If anything does not make sense, let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eneko).

I'll pick dark theme for this one.

My Blog Engine uses two GitHub repositories, the source and the destination (GitHub Pages site), a combination of Github Actions, and few AWS Services.
