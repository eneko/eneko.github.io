There might be better ways to do it, but here is my trick: using system shortcuts.

Here are some of the shortcuts I have, which can be used in most apps on macOS and iOS, thanks to iCloud syncing.

And the table of symbols, for easy copy-pasting:

- Caps Lock: ⇪
- Shift: ⇧ 
- Control (CTRL): ⌃ 
- Option (OPT): ⌥ 
- Command (CMD): ⌘ 

Hope you found this helpful!
