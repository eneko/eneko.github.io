If you've been following my recent tweets or issues on this my [Blog](https://github.com/eneko/Blog) repository, you might be aware that a couple of days ago, I started working on this idea of using GitHub Issues for creating post entries for my [GitHub Pages Jekyll site](https://www.enekoalonso.com).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Iâ€™ve started working on a new event driven, server-less blogging engine for my GitHub Pages blog. <br><br>100% over-engineered, just for fun.</p>&mdash; Eneko Alonso (@eneko) <a href="https://twitter.com/eneko/status/1341249399742029824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After several hours of super fun work spread over these three days, between bike rides, walks, movies, and other PTO fun, I managed to put together this _Frankestein_ of blogging engine. And this is just the start (or so I believe).

The most important thing is that **it works!**

## Current Architecture

As described in my previous articles, I thought of building this using only GitHub Actions. However, I really like working with AWS Services, so this was an opportunity to have some fun and implement a couple of things: an SQS queue, and a Lambda function (in Swift) for processing events.
