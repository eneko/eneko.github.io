Following with my blog engine project (see #1 and #2), I've updated my GitHub Actions trigger as follows:

```yaml
name: New Issue

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  pushToSNS:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${{ github.event.issue.user.login == github.repository_owner }} # only owner issues
    steps:
      - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-2

      - uses: isbang/sqs-action@v0.1.1
        with:
          sqs-url: https://sqs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/855037544458/blog-issue-updates
          message: '{ "issueId": ${{github.event.issue.number}}, "user": "${{github.event.issue.user.login}}", "event": "${{github.event_name}}", "action": "${{github.action}}" }'
```

First, I've added a check to ensure the issue author is the same as the repository owner. This means only issues I create will trigger the workflow and end up on my blog. This is achieved by the following line:

```yaml
if: ${{ github.event.issue.user.login == github.repository_owner }} # only owner issues
```

Next, I've updated the JSON payload to include the event name and the action. The event name matches the expected `issues` event, but the action is not what I expected:

```
 body: "{ \"issueId\": 2, \"user\": \"eneko\", \"event\": \"issues\", \"action\": \"isbangsqs-action\" }"
```

I'm trying to identify if the issue is being created or updated. I could have two separate workflows instead, and hardcode the value, but I would expect the [event activity type](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#issues) to be somewhere in the [event object](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#github-context).
