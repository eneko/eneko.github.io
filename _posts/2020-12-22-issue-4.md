Rather than digging through the [`github` context](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#github-context) in YAML, I decided to use [`toJSON()`](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#tojson) to encode the entire context and send it to Amazon SQS.

```yaml
message: ${ { toJSON(github) } }
```

Still not sure if that will provide enough information to identify the [Activity Type](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#issues) being performed in the issue.

#### Update
It's been a busy day, but now I'm back at it. After testing this new flow, sending the entire JSON payload to SQS, looks like `github.event.action` contains the Activity Type. This means that with a single workflow, I can control on the AWS side how to react depending if action being taken in the issue (`opened`, `edited`, `closed`, `labeled`, `unlabeled`...).

Eventually I want to look into issue comments, but for that, I'll probably define a separate workflow. We will see.

#### Update 2
It seems I won't be using my [GitHub Graph API client](https://github.com/eneko/github), at least not for now, since the SQS message will contain the entire event, including all issue details.

## Next steps

- Configure GitHub action to push Issue updates to Amazon SQS (#1) ✅
- Configure an AWS Lambda to process the incoming messages (#2) ✅
- Retrieve entire issue details via GitHub Graph API, or embed in message (#3 & #4) ✅
- Automate creation of blog post on GitHub pages (via direct commit, or pull request)
- Send me a notification via email or SMS with the url of the new blog post (using AWS SNS)
- Potentially store a mapping of GitHub issues to blog URLs (and file paths) on a DynamoDB table
